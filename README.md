# dotfiles_ansible
This is a complete installation and configuration of my macOS and Ubuntu environments

## Ideas
The goal is to be able to create a new Ubuntu server running on Vagrant and then on the initial 
boot have it fetch and run the current Ansible playbooks and complete all configurations with
zero or minimal interaction.


This will probably be a never ending tweak-a-thon, but it will be worth it.


Using my current dotfiles repository as a starting point is probably the best plan of action.
